# Source-insight-macro-for-doxygen

If you are using source insight 4 and want a doxygen macro for generate comment easier
the doxygen.em would help. Just put the doxygen.em into base project

the code is from internet and i don't really remember where i get it
if someone know, please let me know.

I modify the doxygem function comment, since the original macro miss some function
